# Remove your saved albums 

This is a simple Node app that will remove your Spotify albums in bulk. 

I originally created this in an effort to "restart" my Spotify album, but found
the process of clearing out my saved album list incredibly tedious, since 
you'd need to right-click each album one-by-one to remove. 

This isn't a fully flushed out app, and will require users to get an Access
Token from Spotify's Console page in order to use. In addition, you can only
remove 50 albums at a time, due to rate limit constraints. 

However, for the purposes of removing all your albums in a relatively short
timeframe, it did what I needed it to do.
